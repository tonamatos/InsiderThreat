# InsiderThreat

You have been tasked with reducing alert fatigue for security analysts at a large tech company. Their insider threat stack is mature, with multiple models, IDSbased solutions, and threat hunting methods integrated into providing graphbased events. However, work is still needed to triage, present and explain the events that the analyst sees. Treat each subgraph as the atomic element that
needs to be scored.
